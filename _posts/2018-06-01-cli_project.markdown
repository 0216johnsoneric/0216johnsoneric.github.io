My cli project scrapes data from https://www.imdb.com/chart/boxoffice/ and returns the following data. Title of movie, Gross revenue of movie, and Number of weeks the movie has been in the box office. This project has been the first taste of developing an application by myself with little help and no tests. Overall I really enjoyed the experience. It took me awhile to get a hang of the scrapping, but I can really see how this can be a useful tool in a developers toolbox. The link to my cli application is https://github.com/0216johnsoneric/cli-data-gem-assessment-v-000. Learn.Love.Code
